==========

Data from flight MH370 as PDF and CSV. This was mainly done to try out the table extract tool from scraper wiki which seems to work nicely.

About
=====

Please refer to the source PDF for notes and authoratative data. The CSV should be treated with caution as it is an extract from the PDF. As anyone who has attempted to do that before will know, it isn't always successful.

The data was extracted using the PDF Table Extractor from ScraperWiki (https://blog.scraperwiki.com/tools/tablextract/). After extraction the data was re-organised using a text editor. This puts the complete log back together without separating parts for appedicies. The data was then then cleaned using Open Refine (http://openrefine.org).
